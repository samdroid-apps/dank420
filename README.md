# Dank420

A pretty lit static site generator for python3.

Work in progress.

## Design Goals

**Just code it**

Many static site generators are quite brittle.  They only work if you set
things up in a given way.
Dank420 aims to overcome this by being programmed, not configured.  This allows
end users to just override the methods/code; rather than using hackey workarounds.

**Explicit is better than implicit**

Rather than having implicit defaults (like X is a static content directory, etc.),
Dank420 is about having this explicitly specified in code.  This makes
maintaining the site easier.

## Name

**Dank420**

_Dank_ because this is a good static site generator.

_420_ because this is probably the four-hundred and twentieth static site generator
ever made.  (Did the world really need another static site generator?)
